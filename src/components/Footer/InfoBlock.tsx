                IX Swap is a globally accessible decentralized finance platform which allows for exchange of security
                tokens and cryptocurrency. At IX Swap, we look to offer end-to-end infrastructure for the dealing,
                listing, trading and custody of digital assets. We have currently integrated with InvestaX in Singapore
                as a broker-dealer partner, as well as 1st Digital Trust in Hong Kong as our custody partner and also
                work with multiple licensed broker-dealers and distributors to provide access to such digital assets
                globally. At the blockchain level, we have integrated with the Ethereum and Polygon chains and a number
                of protocol integrations are underway.

                Your use of the IX Swap involves various risks, including, but not limited to, losses while digital
                assets are being supplied to the IX Swap protocol and losses due to the fluctuation of prices of tokens
                in a trading pair or liquidity pool. Before using IX Swap, you should review the relevant documentation
                to make sure you understand how IX Swap works.
