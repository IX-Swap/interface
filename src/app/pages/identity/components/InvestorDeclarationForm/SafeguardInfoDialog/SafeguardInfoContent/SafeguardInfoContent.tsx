            Accredited investors are considered to be sophisticated investors
            and hence eligible to enjoy more flexible and swift investments not
            available to the general public. Accredited investors are expected
            to understand more sophisticated investment products and the risks
            associated with them, and have the ability to conduct their own due
            diligence, therefore, allowing for reduced investor disclosures and
            safeguards, including the following:

            information in their regard or regarding the prospectus, on
            securities, such as shares and debentures, units in business trusts
            and collective investment schemes (commonly referred to as mutual
            funds or investment funds) (“Investment Products”) before the
            prospectus or profile statement is registered with the Monetary
            Authority of Singapore (sec. 25(3) and (4)(a), 300(2A) and (2B)(a)
