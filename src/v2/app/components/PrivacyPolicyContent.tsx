        parties who have a legitimate business need to access such information.

        InvestaX takes the protection of your personal data seriously but,
        unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not
        completely secure. Although we will do our best to protect your personal
        data, we cannot guarantee the security of your personal data transmitted
        through the Site; any transmission is at your own risk.

        If your personal data is compromised as a result of breach of our
        security measures, we will promptly notify you of such a breach.&nbsp;

      <p>
        InvestaX will never send you an email asking you for your login
        information. In general, you can protect yourself against phishing by
        never providing personal or login information via a link contained in an
        email; instead, go to the Site directly.
